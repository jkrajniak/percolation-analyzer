# Percolation Detection Analysis

## Description

In a finite MD system with periodic boundary conditions (pbc) of any (triclinic) shape, it is relevant to detect the percolation point in order to formally define the point of gelation. 
Here the percolation point is defined as the time, at which a molecule first percolates (= connects to itself) in each dimension. 

This repository contains the necessary code to analyze whether or not a molecule is percolating, in how many dimensions it does so (1d -> string like, 2d -> sheet like, 3d -> grid-like) and returns the information for each individual connected molecule in the graph provided.
